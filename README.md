# Inventory Management System Project in Laravel

A web-based tool that allows you to conveniently manage stock inventory: Dashboard, Stock Management, Purchasing, Sales, Suppliers, Customers, Outstanding’s, and Payments are all included in this Inventory Management System. The interface has a nice look and feel to it.

The current logged in user’s ID is automatically assigned to all motions, stocks, and inventory items. Laravel’s built-in database transactions cover all inventory actions such as puts, removals, and creations. Any exceptions that arise during an inventory update will be automatically rolled back.

## What is an Inventory Management System and How Does It Work?
There are several important components to an inventory management system. Inventory control is based on tracking the two primary tasks of a warehouse: receiving (incoming) and shipping (outgoing). Other tasks, such as inventory movement or relocation, are also carried out. The value of raw resources is decremented, while the value of finished goods is increased.
